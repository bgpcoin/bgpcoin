BGPCoin is a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake currency that can be used by Internet Service Providers for real-time settlement of peering expenses such as crossconnects, dark fiber, route advertisement, and bandwidth costs.

BGPCoin can be mined using a CPU miner.  It's recommended to run a BGPCoin node on Ubuntu 17.10, and then use the getwork method of mining and collecting block
miner rewards.

The rewards are 256 BGPCoins per block.

The premined coins in the genesis block will be used to fund development in the
form of code bounties.

Enjoy!
